BBC News Datasets Text Classification (Topic Labeling)

Text documents are one of the richest sources of data for businesses.
Weâ€™ll use a public dataset from the BBC comprised of 2225 articles, each
labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, 
sport or tech.
The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. 
The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously 
unseen news articles into the right category.

The competition is evaluated using Accuracy as a metric.
